<h1>Edit Event</h1>

<!--
  The request created by this form's submission will go to
  "/users/:id/edit" and the HTTP verb will be "post".
-->
<form action="/artist/:id/events/<%= @event.id %>/update" method="post">
  <p>Event Title: <input type="text" name="title" value="<%= @event.title %>"></p>
  <p>Venue: <input type="text" name="venue_name" value="<%= @venues.name %>"></p>
  
  <!--
    The values that this form submits will be stored in a
    Ruby Hash called `params`. Like any Hash, you can get the 
    values by accessing a "key" in the Hash.
    
    For example, you'll be able to do `params[:name]` or
    `params[:age]`. But you can't do that yet! We have to submit
    the form first.

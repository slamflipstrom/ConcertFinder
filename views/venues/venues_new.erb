<!--
  The request created by this form's submission will go to
  "/users/create" and the HTTP verb will be "post".

<form action="/venues/create" method="post">
  <p>Name: <input type="text" name="name"></p>
  <p>City: <input type="text" name="city"></p>

  <!--
    The values that this form submits will be stored in a
    Ruby Hash called `params`. Like any Hash, you can get the 
    values by accessing a "key" in the Hash.
    
    For example, you'll be able to do `params[:name]` or
    `params[:age]`. But you can't do that yet! We have to submit
    the form first.
